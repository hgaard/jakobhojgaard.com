I'm a technology professional with expertise in software architecture, team leadership, and strategic technology consulting. I help organizations navigate complex technical challenges and build effective engineering teams.

With a background spanning software development, architecture, and leadership roles, I focus on bridging the gap between business objectives and technical execution. My approach emphasizes practical solutions, sustainable architecture, and empowering teams to deliver quality software.

I'm available for advisory services in technology strategy, software architecture design, and team leadership. If you're looking for guidance on technical decisions or building effective engineering practices, I'd be happy to connect.
