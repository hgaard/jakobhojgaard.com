Welcome! I'm Jakob Højgaard, and this is my personal website where I share thoughts on technology, software architecture, and engineering leadership.

## Why This Site Exists

After years of working in software development, architecture, and leadership roles, I wanted a space to:

- Share insights and lessons learned from real-world projects
- Document my thinking on technical and organizational challenges
- Connect with others interested in similar topics
- Provide a resource for those seeking advisory services

## What You'll Find Here

This site is organized into a few main sections:

**Experience**: A detailed look at my professional background, the types of projects I've worked on, and the skills I've developed over the years.

**Articles**: Thoughts and insights on technology strategy, software architecture, team leadership, and the practical challenges of building and maintaining software systems.

**Contact**: Information on how to get in touch if you're interested in advisory services or consulting.

## My Approach

I believe in practical solutions over theoretical perfection. Throughout my career, I've found that the best technical decisions are those that balance engineering excellence with business realities. I focus on:

- Sustainable architecture that can evolve with changing requirements
- Building effective engineering teams and practices
- Clear communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Pragmatic approaches to complex problems

## Get in Touch

If you're looking for guidance on technology strategy, software architecture, or building engineering capabilities, I'd be happy to discuss how I can help. You can find my contact information on the [Contact](/contact/) page.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful here.
